## Cabana: CAN Bus Visualizer & Analyzer

Cabana is a Qt-based graphical tool for viewing, analyzing, and reverse-engineering raw CAN bus data. It supports creating and editing DBC (Database CAN) files, plotting signals over time, and optional synchronized video playback.

Cabana was originally developed by the repository author for the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), and is now maintained as a standalone, general-purpose CAN analysis tool.

It supports multiple CAN data sources, including:

- SocketCAN interfaces
- comma.ai panda hardware
- Live streaming via ZMQ/Msgq
- Recorded logs (openpilot routes or custom formats)

No openpilot installation is required. Cabana is suitable for automotive diagnostics, CAN reverse-engineering, research, and any project involving CAN networks.

  --panda                        read can messages from panda
  --panda-serial <panda-serial>  read can messages from panda with given serial
  --socketcan <socketcan>        read can messages from given SocketCAN device
  --zmq <ip-address>             read can messages from zmq at the specified ip-address
                                 messages
  --data_dir <data_dir>          local directory with routes
  --no-vipc                      do not output video
  --dbc <dbc>                    dbc file to open

Arguments:
  route                          the drive to replay. find your drives at
                                 connect.comma.ai
```

## Examples

### Running Cabana in Demo Mode
To run Cabana using a built-in demo route, use the following command:

```shell
cabana --demo
```

### Loading a Specific Route

To load a specific route for replay, provide the route as an argument:

```shell
cabana "a2a0ccea32023010|2023-07-27--13-01-19"
```

Replace "0ccea32023010|2023-07-27--13-01-19" with your desired route identifier.


### Running Cabana with multiple cameras
To run Cabana with multiple cameras, use the following command:

```shell
cabana "a2a0ccea32023010|2023-07-27--13-01-19" --dcam --ecam
```

### Streaming CAN Messages from a comma Device

[SSH into your device](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/SSH) and start the bridge with the following command:

```shell
cd /data/openpilot/cereal/messaging/
./bridge &
```

Then Run Cabana with the device's IP address:

```shell
cabana --zmq <ipaddress>
```

Replace &lt;ipaddress&gt; with your comma device's IP address.

While streaming from the device, Cabana will log the CAN messages to a local directory. By default, this directory is ~/cabana_live_stream/. You can change the log directory in Cabana by navigating to menu -> tools -> settings.

After disconnecting from the device, you can replay the logged CAN messages from the stream selector dialog -> browse local route.

### Streaming CAN Messages from Panda

To read CAN messages from a connected Panda, use the following command:

```shell
cabana --panda
```

### Using the Stream Selector Dialog

If you run Cabana without any arguments, a stream selector dialog will pop up, allowing you to choose the stream.

```shell
cabana
```
